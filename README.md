# traffcnt
Traffic counting based on opencv (Background-substraction and findContours) and after the basic ideas for object tracking through the different frames in a reference-program by Chris D. see https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV_3_Car_Counting_Cpp
To build and run the opencv-libraries must be installed, developed under version opencv 3.4 - download or build f.i. see: https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html 


Changes: 
- suitable now for ordinary g++ on linux, changing some syntax
- detects direction and has distinct counters per direction 
- added a simple approach to build different classes of moving objects just by object's-size
- german explainations in source-code

Compile hint: Let's say <OPENCV_PATH> is the path, where opencv files are placed then compile it by 
`g++ main.cpp -o traffcnt -I<OPENCV_PATH>/include -L<OPENCV_PATH>/lib -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_video -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_core`
For instance <OPENCV_PATH> is /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/3.4.0 then:
`g++ main.cpp -o traffcnt -I/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/3.4.0/include -L/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/3.4.0/lib -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_video -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_core`
