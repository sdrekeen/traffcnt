# traffcnt
Traffic counting based on opencv (Background-substraction and findContours) and after the basic ideas for object tracking through the different frames in a reference-program by Chris D. see https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV_3_Car_Counting_Cpp

Changes: 
- suitable now for ordinary g++ on linux, changing some syntax
- detects direction and has distinct counters per direction 
- added a simple approach to build different classes of moving objects just by object's-size
- german explainations in source-code
